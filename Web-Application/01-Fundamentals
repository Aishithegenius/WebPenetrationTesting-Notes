A web application is a program that runs in your browser. Unlike normal software that you install on your computer, a web application lives on a server somewhere on the internet, and you access it using a browser like Chrome or Firefox.
When you open a web app, your browser talks to a server. The browser asks for data, and the server sends back a response. This back-and-forth communication is what makes the app interactive.

Examples of web applications include Gmail, Google Docs, Amazon, Hack The Box, and online banking websites.

*Web Applications vs Websites

In the past, websites were mostly static. This means everyone saw the same content, and nothing changed when users interacted with the page. These are called Web 1.0 websites.

Modern websites are actually web applications. They change based on user input, login status, and actions. This is called Web 2.0.

A website mainly shows information.
A web application allows users to do things.

Web applications:
Can log users in
Can store data
Can show different content to different users
Can update content without refreshing the page

*Web Applications vs Native Applications

Native applications are installed on your device, like WhatsApp desktop or Microsoft Word.

Web applications:
Run inside a browser
Do not need installation
Work on any operating system
Are updated in one place on the server

Native applications:
Are faster
Have deeper access to the operating system
Can use device hardware more efficiently

Modern apps sometimes mix both ideas using hybrid or progressive web apps.

Web Application Security Importance

Web applications are exposed to the internet, meaning anyone in the world can interact with them. This makes them a major target for attackers.

If a web application is vulnerable:
User data can be stolen
Passwords can leak
Databases can be accessed
Servers can be taken over

Because web apps often connect to databases and internal systems, one small mistake can lead to very big damage.

WEB APPLICATION LAYOUT

A web application is made up of multiple parts working together. These parts are organized into infrastructure, components, and architecture.

Web Application Infrastructure

Infrastructure describes how servers and databases are arranged.

Client Server Model

In this model:
The client is the browser
The server hosts the application

The browser sends requests.
The server processes them and sends responses back.

One Server Model

Everything runs on one server:
Web server
Application code
Database

This is easy to set up but very dangerous. If the server is hacked, everything is compromised.

Many Servers One Database

Multiple web servers connect to one database.

This improves security and reliability.
If one web server is compromised, others may still be safe.

Many Servers Many Databases

Each application has its own database.

This is the most secure and scalable design.
If one application is hacked, the others are protected.

WEB APPLICATION COMPONENTS

Every web application is made of these components.

Client  
The browser used by the user.

Web Server  
Handles HTTP requests. Examples include Apache, NGINX, IIS.

Application Logic  
The actual code that processes requests and applies rules.

Database  
Stores user data, passwords, posts, products, etc.

APIs and Services  
Allow different parts of the app or other apps to communicate.

Third Party Integrations  
External services like payment gateways or email providers.

WEB APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE

Most web applications follow a three-layer structure.

Presentation Layer

This is what the user sees.
It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Runs in the browser.

Application Layer

This is the brain of the app.
It checks permissions.
It processes requests.
It decides what data a user is allowed to see.

Data Layer

This is where data lives.
Databases store and retrieve information.
The application layer talks to the database, not the user.

FRONT END VS BACK END

Front End

The front end is everything the user can see and touch.

It includes:
HTML for structure
CSS for design
JavaScript for behavior

Front end controls how the app looks and feels.
A badly optimized front end can make an app feel slow even if the server is fast.

Back End

The back end does the real work.

Main jobs performed by back end components:

1. Handle login and authentication
The back end checks usernames and passwords and decides if a user is allowed in.

2. Process user requests
When a user searches, uploads a file, or clicks a button, the back end decides what to do.

3. Communicate with databases
The back end reads and writes data like users, posts, and messages.

4. Enforce permissions and roles
It decides who is an admin and who is a normal user.

5. Provide APIs
The back end sends data to the front end in formats like JSON.

6. Integrate external services
Payments, emails, and notifications are handled here.

ATTACKING WEB APPLICATIONS

Web applications are a huge attack surface because they change often and are accessible from anywhere.

Common web application attacks include:

SQL Injection  
Bad input handling allows attackers to read or modify database data.

File Inclusion  
Attackers load files they should not be able to access.

Unrestricted File Upload  
Uploading malicious files can lead to server takeover.

Broken Access Control  
Users access features or data they should not have permission to use.

IDOR  
Changing IDs in URLs to access other users’ data.

Why this matters

One vulnerability can be chained with another.
Data stolen from one app can be used to attack other systems.
That is why understanding web applications is critical for penetration testing.

FINAL NOTE

Web applications are not magic.
They are just systems that take input, process it, and return output.
Most vulnerabilities come from trusting user input too much.

If you understand how data flows from browser to server to database and back, web hacking becomes logical instead of confusing.
