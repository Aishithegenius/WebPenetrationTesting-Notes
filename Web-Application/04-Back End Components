BACK END SERVERS

What a Back End Server Is
A back end server is the real computer (or virtual computer) that runs everything behind a website or web app. It does the thinking and the work. Users never see it directly.

It belongs to the Data Access Layer because it handles data, logic, and processing.

What Runs on a Back End Server
The back end server usually runs these main components:

* Web Server
* Database
* Development Framework

It may also run:

* Containers (Docker)
* Virtual machines (hypervisors)
* Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

Common Back End Stacks
A stack is just a common combination of software used together.

Examples:

* LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
* WAMP: Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP
* WINS: Windows, IIS, .NET, SQL Server
* MAMP: macOS, Apache, MySQL, PHP
* XAMPP: Cross‑platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl

Hardware
The hardware (CPU, RAM, disk) affects speed and stability. Big websites do not rely on one server. They spread the load across many servers or use cloud providers.

WEB SERVERS

What a Web Server Is
A web server is a program that listens for HTTP requests from browsers and sends back responses.

It usually listens on:

* Port 80 (HTTP)
* Port 443 (HTTPS)

What a Web Server Does

* Receives requests from browsers
* Sends them to the correct page or app logic
* Returns responses (HTML, JSON, files, errors)

Common HTTP Response Codes

* 200 OK: request succeeded
* 301 Moved Permanently: URL changed forever
* 302 Found: URL changed temporarily
* 400 Bad Request: request is broken
* 401 Unauthorized: not logged in
* 403 Forbidden: access denied
* 404 Not Found: page does not exist
* 405 Method Not Allowed: wrong HTTP method
* 408 Request Timeout: request took too long
* 500 Internal Server Error: server crashed
* 502 Bad Gateway: invalid response from another server
* 504 Gateway Timeout: another server did not respond

Web servers handle user input such as:

* Form data
* JSON
* File uploads

Popular Web Servers

Apache

* Most common web server
* Open source
* Easy to configure
* Commonly used with PHP
* Used by startups and some big companies

NGINX

* Very fast and efficient
* Handles many users at the same time
* Popular for high‑traffic websites
* Used by Google, Netflix, Facebook, HTB

IIS

* Made by Microsoft
* Runs on Windows Server
* Works very well with .NET and Active Directory
* Used by large enterprises

Other web servers include:

* Apache Tomcat (Java)
* Node.js (JavaScript backend)

DATABASES

Why Databases Are Used
Databases store data such as:

* User accounts
* Passwords
* Posts
* Images
* Files

They allow websites to be dynamic and personalized.

Main Database Types

Relational Databases (SQL)

* Use tables, rows, and columns
* Have clear structure
* Use relationships between tables

Example:

* users table
* posts table linked by user_id

Key ideas:

* Tables can be linked
* Structure is strict
* Very fast for structured data

Common SQL Databases

* MySQL
* MSSQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* SQLite

Non‑Relational Databases (NoSQL)

* No tables or fixed structure
* Very flexible
* Very scalable

Common NoSQL Models

* Key‑Value
* Document‑Based
* Wide‑Column
* Graph

Key‑Value Example (JSON‑like)

* Key points to data
* Value can be text, object, or list

Common NoSQL Databases

* MongoDB (Document‑based)
* ElasticSearch (search‑optimized)
* Cassandra (high availability)
* Redis, Neo4j, DynamoDB

Databases in Web Apps
Web apps connect to databases using code.
User input is often used in database queries.

If not coded safely, this can cause vulnerabilities like SQL Injection.

DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS

What Frameworks Are
Frameworks are toolkits that help developers build web apps faster.
They provide ready‑made features like:

* Login systems
* Routing
* Database connections

Popular Frameworks

* Laravel (PHP)
* Express (Node.js)
* Django (Python)
* Ruby on Rails

Large websites usually use more than one framework or service.

APIs AND WEB APIs

What an API Is
An API is a way for one program to talk to another.

In web apps, APIs let the front end talk to the back end.

Simple idea:

* Front end asks for something
* Back end processes it
* Back end sends back a response

Query Parameters
Data sent through the URL or POST body.

Examples:

* GET /search.php?item=apples
* POST /search.php with item=apples

Query parameters let one page handle many inputs.

SOAP API

What SOAP Is
SOAP sends data using XML.
Both request and response are XML.

SOAP is good for:

* Complex data
* Structured objects
* Stateful applications

SOAP drawbacks:

* Hard to read
* Long and complex
* Not beginner‑friendly

REST API

What REST Is
REST uses URLs to represent data.
It usually returns JSON.

Example:

* GET /users/1

REST ideas:

* Small focused endpoints
* Simple structure
* Easy to scale

Common REST HTTP Methods

* GET: read data
* POST: create data
* PUT: update or replace data
* DELETE: remove data

FINAL SIMPLE SUMMARY
Front end shows
Back end decides
Database remembers
APIs communicate
Security checks everything
