COMMON WEB VULNERABILITIES (OWASP TOP 10 CONTEXT)

These are common weaknesses found during web penetration testing. They may come from bad coding, poor input validation, or misconfiguration by developers.

1. Broken Authentication
   This happens when login systems are weak.
   Attackers can:

* Log in without valid credentials
* Take over another user’s session
* Escalate privileges (normal user → admin)

Example:
Using payloads like:
' or 0=0 #
To bypass login checks.

2. Broken Access Control
   This happens when users can access things they should not.

Example:

* A normal user accessing /admin
* Changing URLs to access other users’ data

3. SQL Injection (SQLi)
   Occurs when user input is directly placed into SQL queries without validation.

Example vulnerable code:
select * from users where name like '%$input%'

Attackers can:

* Bypass login
* Read database data
* Modify or delete records

4. Command Injection
   Occurs when user input is passed to operating system commands.

Attackers can:

* Execute system commands
* Gain server control

Example:
Input like:
127.0.0.1 | whoami

5. Malicious File Upload
   Occurs when file uploads are not properly validated.

Attackers can:

* Upload web shells
* Execute code on the server

Example bypass:
shell.php.jpg

PUBLIC VULNERABILITIES (CVE)

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are publicly disclosed security issues.

Why they matter:

* Already discovered
* Often have ready-made exploits
* High risk if unpatched

Penetration testing first step:

1. Identify application version
2. Search for CVEs for that version
3. Look for high severity (CVSS 8–10)

Useful exploit databases:

* Exploit DB
* Rapid7
* Vulnerability Lab

Example:
CVE-2014-6271
Category: Command Injection (Shellshock)

CVSS – COMMON VULNERABILITY SCORING SYSTEM

CVSS gives vulnerabilities a score from 0 to 10.
Higher score = more dangerous.

CVSS v2.0 Severity:

* Low: 0.0 – 3.9
* Medium: 4.0 – 6.9
* High: 7.0 – 10.0

CVSS v3.0 Severity:

* None: 0.0
* Low: 0.1 – 3.9
* Medium: 4.0 – 6.9
* High: 7.0 – 8.9
* Critical: 9.0 – 10.0

Important facts:

* NVD provides Base scores only
* Temporal and Environmental scores depend on organization context

Example CVE:
CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue)
CVSS v2.0 Score: 9.3

BACK-END SERVER VULNERABILITIES

Web servers are exposed to the internet, so they are high-value targets.

Examples:

* Apache Shellshock
* IIS misconfigurations

Other back-end vulnerabilities:

* Database privilege escalation
* OS-level vulnerabilities

These are often exploited after gaining initial access.

OWASP TOP 10 (INCLUDE IN GITHUB NOTES)

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection (SQLi, Command Injection)
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

NEXT STEPS FOR PRACTICE

1. Set up a web server (Apache / NGINX)
2. Create basic HTML + CSS
3. Add JavaScript
4. Build a simple backend app
5. Connect to a database
6. Use APIs
7. Test for vulnerabilities
8. Fix the vulnerabilities
9. Practice on Hack The Box Easy machines

FINAL SIMPLE SUMMARY

Front end shows
Back end decides
Database remembers
APIs communicate
Security checks everything
